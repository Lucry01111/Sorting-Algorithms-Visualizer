# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer üìä

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to visualize how they work:
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and places it in its correct position.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element in its correct position.
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller parts, sorts them, and merges them back together.
  - **Quick Sort**: Selects a pivot element and partitions the array into subarrays, sorting them recursively.

- **Customizable Input Data**: Input your own data set to see how each algorithm performs.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the sorting algorithms in action with dynamic, step-by-step updates on the screen.
